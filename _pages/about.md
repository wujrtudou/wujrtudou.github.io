I am a researcher based in Brisbane, Australia, specializing in statistical machine learning, temporal data modeling, and engineering optimization. I completed my PhD in Statistics at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). My main areas of interest include time series regression, bio-signal recognition, kernel methods, and developing machine learning solutions for practical challenges in social sciences and engineering.

Over the years, I have worked as a Research Fellow at Australian Catholic University, as well as teaching roles at QUT. My research often focuses on combining statistical models with real-world applications, and I’ve had the opportunity to publish on topics like smart grid systems, environmental modeling, and advanced regression techniques.

Beyond research, I contribute to the academic community as a peer reviewer and guest editor for various journals and special issues. I’ve also been fortunate to receive several awards, including the Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Self-Financed Students Abroad, which highlights my dedication to both my field and international collaboration.
